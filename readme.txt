Minimal Georgia Theme

A sweet multi-color theme filled with Georgia goodness. Two columns, widgets and menus. Install the theme and browse to the Theme Options in order to change the color scheme and a few other options.

Theme features:

 * two-columns
 * fixed-width
 * custom-colors
 * custom-menu
 * theme-options
 * threaded-comments
 * translation-ready
 * sticky-post
 * editor-style

Notes & Limitations:

 * Primary menu supports up to 6 items (depending on their names) because of the width limitation. If more are added, the extra is not visible.
 * The Preview script and stylesheet are loaded if you haven't placed any widgets on your sidebar, this results in a Color Schemes block in the sidebar. Drop at least one widget on to your sidebar to get rid of it.
