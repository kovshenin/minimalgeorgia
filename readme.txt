Minimal Georgia Theme

A sweet multi-color theme filled with Georgia goodness. Two columns, widgets and menus.
Install the theme and browse to the Theme Options in order to change the color scheme
and a few other options.

Theme features:

 * two-columns
 * fixed-width
 * custom-colors
 * custom-menu
 * theme-options
 * threaded-comments
 * translation-ready
 * sticky-post

Notes & Limitations:

 * Primary menu supports up to 6 items (depending on their names) because of the width limitation. If more are added, the extra is not visible.
